## Features

- **AI-Powered Trading**: Utilizes reinforcement learning models to make intelligent trading decisions.
- **Multi-DEX Support**: Operates across multiple decentralized exchanges simultaneously.
- **High-Performance Backend**: Go-based backend for efficient order management and execution.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Solidity contracts for on-chain operations and liquidity provision.
- **GPU Acceleration**: CUDA and Triton optimizations for high-speed computations.
- **Real-time Risk Management**: Continuous monitoring and adjusting of risk exposure.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Web-based interface for real-time monitoring and control.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design allowing easy integration of new DEXs and trading strategies.

## Architecture

OuroBroker consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Smart Contracts**: 
   - `MarketMaker.sol`: Main contract for executing trades and managing liquidity.
   - `LiquidityPoolManager.sol`: Manages liquidity across different pools.
   - `RiskManagement.sol`: Implements on-chain risk management strategies.

2. **Backend Services**:
   - `main.go`: Entry point for the backend service.
   - `order_manager.go`: Manages order creation and execution.
   - `dex_interface.go`: Interfaces with various DEXs.
   - `risk_monitor.go`: Off-chain risk monitoring and management.
   - `config.go`: Configuration management for the backend.

3. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - `model_training.py`: Trains the reinforcement learning models.
   - `model_inference.py`: Performs inference for real-time decision making.
   - `reinforcement_env.py`: Simulates the trading environment for training.
   - `data_pipeline.py`: Manages data ingestion and preprocessing.

4. **GPU Acceleration**:
   - `cuda_kernels.cu`: Custom CUDA kernels for parallelized operations.
   - `triton_functions.py`: Triton-based optimizations for machine learning models.

5. **C++ Components**:
   - `order_book.cpp/h`: Implements a fast, in-memory order book.
   - `trade_executor.cpp/h`: Executes trades with minimal latency.

6. **Dashboard**:
   - `index.html`: Main dashboard page.
   - `app.js`: Frontend logic for the dashboard.
   - `styles.css`: Styling for the dashboard.
   - `api_endpoint.go`: Backend API for the dashboard.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/selimozten/ourobroker.git
   cd ourobroker
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
